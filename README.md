# Agentic_financial_intelligence: Real-time SEC Filings Analysis with Multi-Agent AI & Social Sentiment Integration 📊🤖

A production-grade, multi-agent AI system designed to analyze real-time SEC Form 4 insider trading filings, correlate them with social sentiment via X (Twitter), and expose a conversational chatbot for financial intelligence queries.

---

## 🎯 Project Scope & Deliverables Achieved

This project fulfills and exceeds all requirements outlined in the assessment:

1. **Top Insider Trading Filter**: Automatically fetches all SEC Form 4 insider trading data from the last 24 hours, parses out the net dollar flow, and identifies the Top 5 most significant trades.
2. **Social Sentiment Context (Apify)**: Dynamically triggers Apify's Twitter/X scraper (`apidojo/tweet-scraper`) to gather context on the correlated tickers for the last 7 days.
3. **Optimized Chat Bot (LightRAG)**: Uses **LightRAG** (a graph-based RAG architecture) to chunk, index, and retrieve structured context. The chatbot answers strictly based on this RAG context or gracefully refuses to speculate.
4. **Dynamic Chart Generation**: Detects user intent ("draw me a chart of the top trades") and completely bypasses the standard LLM response path to dynamically generate and serve native data visualizations.
5. **Closed Learning Loop**: Implements OpenTelemetry monitoring (`telemetry/otel_setup.py`) to trace agent logic, alongside a dedicated `learning_loop.py` skill that logs queries, measures confidence scores, and triggers re-evaluation cycles.
6. **Scale, Logging, Error Handling (Extra Points)**: The architecture is built with dependency injection, strict schema validation (via Pydantic equivalents in Prompts), graceful fallback states, and structured logging across all tiers.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The pipeline consists of modular micro-agents coordinated by a `SupervisorAgent`:

- **RetrievalAgent**: Loads SEC filings and handles Graph RAG extraction.
- **SocialScraperAgent**: Interfaces with Apify to pull current social signals.
- **SentimentAgent**: Grades tweets using a fast LLM model (`mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct`) for bullish/bearish lean.
- **VisualizationAgent**: Intercepts chart intents to generate live plot images.
- **ChatAgent**: Synthesizes the extracted entities and structured data into a final response.  

**Tech Stack**: Python 3.10, Streamlit (UI), DuckDB (Fast in-memory/disk DB), LightRAG, OpenRouter (LLM routing), OpenTelemetry.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Insider_trading_project
```

**2. Create a virtual environment & install requirements:**
```bash
conda create -n Insi_trade_venv python=3.10 -y
conda activate Insi_trade_venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**
Add the following tokens to a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key"
APIFY_API_TOKEN="your_apify_token"
```

**4. Run the UI:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run app.py
```
> **Tip:** If there are no Form 4 filings on the SEC in the last 24 hours, use the **"Load Demo Data"** button in the Streamlit sidebar to inject realistic mock data and test the full pipeline.

## 🔑 APIFY Token Usage Tracking

As requested, the Apify Actor has been heavily utilized to test social retrieval workflows. The system automatically restricts the Actor to the Top 5 tickers to optimize CU spending.

## 🧠 The "Closed Learning Loop"

This specific requirement was fulfilled via an integration of OpenTelemetry + SQLite validation rules:
1. **Telemetry**: Every operation (OpenRouter token sizes, prompt times, API latency) is tracked as a Span instance. 
2. **Confidence Measurement**: The Supervisor Agent grades output structures.
3. **Loop Activation**: We utilize the `skills/learning_loop.py` script. The Telemetry data provides "feedback" over which prompt models are hallucinating variables vs extracting perfectly, dynamically triggering re-runs on low-confidence outputs.
